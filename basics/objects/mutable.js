// 9. What does the following program log to the console? Why?

let foo = {
  a: 'hello',
  b: 'world',
};

let qux = 'hello';

function bar(argument1, argument2) {
  argument1.a = 'hi';
  argument2 = 'hi';
}

bar(foo, qux);

console.log(foo.a);
console.log(qux);


/*

The program logs 'hi' and 'hello' The reason behind this is that objects are 
mutable; strings and other primitives are not. Also, variable reassignment, 
such as that on line 10, doesn't mutate the original object even when the 
object is mutable. Thus, line 9 mutates the foo by assigning its a property 
to a new value ('hi'). Therefore, the code on line 15 logs hi. On the other 
hand, line 10 reassigns the argument2 variable, but it doesn't mutate the 
string represented by qux. Thus, line 16 logs hello: the original value of 
he qux variable.
