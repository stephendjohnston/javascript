/*
Clean Up the Words
------------------
Given a string that consists of some words and an assortment of non-alphabetic 
characters, write a function that returns that string with all of the non-alphabetic 
characters replaced by spaces. If one or more non-alphabetic characters occur in a row, 
you should only have one space in the result (i.e., the result string should never have 
consecutive spaces).

Example:

cleanUp("---what's my +*& line?");    // " what s my line "

PEDAC

Problem:
--------

Take a String argument and remove all non-alphabetic characters and replace with
space characters. If there are consecutive non-alpha characters, there should also 
be only one space character to replace them. 

Algorithm:
----------

Remove all non-alpha characters from the string and repalce them with space
characters. Then go through the string again and remove consecutive space
characters. 

- create a for loop to iterate through each character of the string
- if a character is alphabetic, add that character to the new string
- if the character is non-alphabetic, add a space character to the string
unless the last character in the new string is a space character
-

function isAlphabetic(char) {
  const Alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ';

  return Alphabet.includes(char);
}

function cleanUp(text) {
  const Regex = / {2,}/g;
  let cleanString = '';

  for (let index = 0; index < text.length; index += 1) {
    let currentChar = text[index];

    if (isAlphabetic(currentChar)) {
      cleanString += currentChar;
    } else {
      cleanString += ' ';
    }
  }

  return cleanString.replace(Regex, ' ');
}

cleanUp("---what's my +*& line?");    // " what s my line "

// LS Solution:

function cleanUp(text) {
  let cleanText = '';

  for (let i = 0; i < text.length; i += 1) {
    if (isLowerCaseLetter(text[i]) || isUpperCaseLetter(text[i])) {
      cleanText += text[i];
    } else if (cleanText[cleanText.length - 1] !== ' ') {
      cleanText += ' ';
    }
  }

  return cleanText;
}

const isLowerCaseLetter = (char) => char >= 'a' && char <= 'z';

const isUpperCaseLetter = (char) => char >= 'A' && char <= 'Z';

// Further Exploration:
/*
If you originally wrote your solution without using regular expressions, 
try writing it with regular expressions to see how expressive and concise 
your code can become. Note, however, that using regular expressions can 
sometimes make your code less readable.

  return text.replace(/[^a-z]+/gi, ' ');
