/*
The processOrder function shown below accepts the following arguments: price, 
quantity, discount, serviceCharge and tax. Any arguments other than price may 
be omitted when calling the function, in which case, default values will be assigned.
*/

function processOrder(price, quantity, discount, serviceCharge, tax) {
  if (!quantity) {
    quantity = 1;
  }

  if (!discount) {
    discount = 0;
  }

  if (!serviceCharge) {
    serviceCharge = 0.1;
  }

  if (!tax) {
    tax = 0.15;
  }

  return (price * quantity) * (1 - discount) * (1 + serviceCharge) * (1 + tax);
}

console.log(processOrder(100));

/*
This function uses conditional statements to test whether arguments have been omitted. 
When an argument is omitted, JavaScript automatically initializes it to a value of undefined. 
The function takes advantage of this behavior by setting undefined arguments to a default value.

The following variation of the processOrder function has the same behavior as the first:
*/

function processOrder(price, quantity, discount, serviceCharge, tax) {
  quantity = quantity || 1;
  discount = discount || 0;
  serviceCharge = serviceCharge || 0.1;
  tax = tax || 0.15;

  return (price * quantity) * (1 - discount) * (1 + serviceCharge) * (1 + tax);
}

/*
However, both of these solutions have a limitation that can lead to an incorrect result for certain 
inputs. What is this limitation and how does it affect the result?
*/

// Solution
/*
The limitation of these solutions is that when one of the optional arguments has a value of 0, the 
function incorrectly treats that argument as if it has been omitted. For example:
*/

processOrder(100, 2, 0.1, 0, 0);      // 227.7 -- incorrect result!

/*
This happens because 0 is a falsy value in JavaScript, so any arguments with a value of 0 get 
reassigned a default value. One way to prevent this from happening is to explicitly test whether the 
input arguments have a value of undefined, instead of relying on them being falsy â€” e.g., (quantity === undefined). 
(Note that when the value passed for discount is 0, the function works as expected because the default value of 
discount is also 0.)
